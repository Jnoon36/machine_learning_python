Pulsars are some of the most fascinating objects in the Universe. They are neutron stars that emit powerful beams of EM radiation. The task here was to classify and predict which particular stars are that of pulsars. Using Machine learning, we can train a classification algorithm on a data set to learn which characteristics are associated with pulsars, and which are not.
