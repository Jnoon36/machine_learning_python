Pulsars are some of the most fascinating objects in the Universe. They are neutron stars that emit powerful beams of EM radiation. The task here was to classify data that contained stars which are not pulsars and stars which are pulsars. Using Machine learning, we can train a classification algorithm on a data set to learn which characteristics are associated with pulsars, and which are not.
